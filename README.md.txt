Coursera and Johns Hopkins University 
Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

Enter the text in the box on the "Text Prediction" tab. The predicted word will be returned
on the line below as well as a list of all entered words below the predicted word.

The goal of the project is to predict the next word to be entered by the user
based on the previous up to 3 words entered. The text prediction is based on corpora
randomly gathered from blogs, news sites, and twitter provided by the class. These
corpora have been randomly sampled, scrubbed of foul language, and modified for usability.

All relevant code for this project is available on github.
